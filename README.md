# The Story of Talendar

For Alwyn Tan and myself, Talendar was our first foray into a large software project. Talendar taught us both a lot about the process of birthing a product and a lot of joy. Over the past year or so Talendar went from a few lines of code to a feature-rich (though not nearly enough) app. We worked on it during late nights, weekends, whenever we had time really.

Today we are publishing:

Talendar version 1.001 + a feature list weâ€™ve built + a future feature list we might work on. (These will be up on the website soon).

But after a lot of development, weâ€™ve also decided to archive Talendar into our dormant projects folder ðŸ˜”




# The Product hypotheses:
People juggling a lot of work would prefer to outsource the overhead of organizing the order of tackling that work to an app. People would find the experience of just focusing on one piece of work at a time, extremely satisfactory and would pay a subscription fee to use the app.

Most people procrastinate work that is not externally given to them. For example a pledge to read more books or a pledge to make to make music. We hypothesize that this is because the biggest activation energy for starting work on these pledges is in finding a time to work on them.

The above two needs were not satisfactorily met in the market.

To meet these two hypothesizes:

We built a lightweight Todo List+ Calendar application that automatically schedules todos into your calendar.
